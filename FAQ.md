# Frequently Asked Questions #

## Where are the comics saved? ##

The comics are saved as .jpg images in the Pictures folder on your SD card. The Android OS will eventually detect them and put them in the Gallery.
This might take some time to happen. If you are impatient, then either connect your phone in mass storage mode to a computer and browse to that folder, or use a file manager to naviage to that folder on the SD card and open the file from there.

## How do I share to Reddit/Imgur? ##

Because of how the Android OS is layed out, I didn't find it necessary to bake in these features, since you can already do this with 2 free apps from the Market.

First the excellent Imgur Android application that will add the option to share to Imgur. The next step is to use the Reddit is fun application from Imgur and do a share to the desired subreddit (e.g. f7u12).

Also, the Baconreader application is capable of directly sharing images to Reddit, so using that you can do the sharing in one step!

## I have a bug report or an idea! Should I send an e-mail? ##

Please use the Report a bug feature in the About dialog in the application, or use the Issues tab on the app's home page instead.
